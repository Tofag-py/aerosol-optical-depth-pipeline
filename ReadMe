# Data Ingestion, Orchestration, and Linear Regression Model for Aerosol Optical Depth

This project demonstrates how to automate the ingestion, cleaning, processing, and analysis of aerosol optical depth data for Africa. The pipeline is designed to work with Prefect for workflow orchestration, Pandas for data manipulation, and Scikit-learn for building a linear regression model to predict aerosol optical depth. The project includes the following stages:

1. **Data Ingestion**
2. **Data Storage**
3. **Data Cleaning & Processing**
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
5. **Model Training**
6. **Containerization & Deployment**

## Project Overview

This project automates the ingestion of aerosol optical depth data from an open-source dataset and performs the following:

1. **Download data** using the Prefect task system.
2. **Clean and preprocess the data** with Pandas.
3. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
4. **Train a linear regression model** using Scikit-learn to predict aerosol optical depth based on several features.
5. **Deploy the model** via FastAPI and containerize the entire process using Docker.
6. **Scale** using Kubernetes (optional).
